# Placement-Data-Analysis
Placement of students is one of the most important objectives of an educational institution.
Any assistance in this particular area will have a positive impact on an institution’s ability to place its students.
In this regard,  previous data has been analyzed and visualised.

The objective of this project is to analyse previous year's student data and study the trends, patterns from the analysis to know the features that are influencing a student’s placement. Data pertaining to the study was collected from the institution for which the Data Visualisation is done, and also suitable data pre-processing methods like cleaning of data set (removing noise and inconsistent data), Integration of data (integrating multiple sources), Selection of data, Transformation of data (transforming into the appropriate form), Mining the data (extracting relevant data) are applied. Interesting plots allow a visual inspection of the situation of the institution regarding the placements. The goal is to track and display information on what percent of students got placed for different branches, on what percent of students got placed for different companies and many more. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of campus placements and compares its impact on different areas of the syllabus with the help of Data Visualization and it will also help derive a better solution in the future.
